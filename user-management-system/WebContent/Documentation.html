<h1>Application Structure </h1>

<p>The structure of this simple web app follows the traditional organizations hierarchy. There is a two types 
of users. Supervisor/Admin and normal user. </p>

<dl>
<h3>Users</h3>
<p><mark>(Note: Username for the Admin is ‘admin’; password is ‘password’. Username for admin cannot be changed)</mark></p>
<b><dt>Supervisor/Admin</dt></b>
<dd> - Also known as a super user. A super user in this simple web app, is the supervisor of the organization/team/company. 
A super user is given the <b>username: admin</b> and <b>password: password </b>. No one can have admin username except for 
to the dedicated admin or signup as an admin. The Admin has the highest privilege, she/he can add and remove users. He/she 
can update every user information except for the password and username.<br />
</dd>
<b><dt>Normal User</dt></b>
<dd> - Normal users are employees or non admin team members. They have the least privilege, they can view shift reports from other team members, clock-in and out, request time off, view their weekly schedule and request for a schedule change. Normal users can also update their user information including first and last name. Here it's assumed that there is an hypothetical process/approval for updating employees informations, and for that reason, if a user update their information, they will have to logout and log back in with their new credentials and everything will look updated.

<h1>Step-wise Instructions: </h1>
<h3>Setting up</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have all the above software downloaded on the machine intended to run this wed up</li>
<li>Open the database_Creator_with_Demo.sql file given in the zip folder. You can also find this file at Webcontent/sql-scripts. Open or run the script inside this file
 in your sql workbench or on terminal to create the required database.</li>
 <li>The script creates a few demo users with all the information needed to login. and an admin username and password </li>
<li>Setup your own password for your database by configuring the password and connection pool under the webcontent/META-INF/context.xml.</li>
<li> If password for the database is not configured correctly at webcontent/META-INF/context.xml, the app will not works</li>
<li>Deploy the war file on your server</li>
</ul>

<h1>Resetting user password</h1>
<p>Here we assume the user's employee id is a secret to them and no one else knows it.
To reset a password, the user must know their username and employee id:</p>
<ul>
<li> Click on reset password on the web GUI </li>
<li> Input the requested information.</li>
<p>If the passed username and employee id are correct, the password will be reset to the 
new one. user should be able to login with their new credentials.</p>
</ul>

<h1>Viewing personal information </h1>
<p>A user can view their personal information by clicking on the user icon at the top left 
side of the web once they are signed in. There, the user should be able to view their profile 
and edit if they wish by clicking on the edit button at the bottom of the page. 
Updating profile also includes changing or resetting their password. As mention earlier, there is 
an hypothetical process for validation of user information from a different vendor. So, user must 
logout and log back in to see their most current updated informations.</p>
<h1>Still under development </h1>
<p>This user management system is a beta, it's still under development. There isn't much a user can do on the 
page currently. Here are the implemented features: logging in, logging out, signing up, updating user information 
and reseting password. All other features are there for display but they are not implemented yet.</p>
